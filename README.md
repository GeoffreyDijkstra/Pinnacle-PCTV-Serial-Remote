# Pinnacle PCTV Serial Remote, Windows Files
There are still a few people looking for the windows files for the Pinnacle PCTV Serial Remote.
So I decided to put them on github. All files needed to get the remote working are included and even the original documentation is added.
I also included a custom configuration to use the remote with Kodi (aka XBMC)

# Installation (Windows)
1. Copy the "remote" folder to a location of choice.
2. Connect your PCTV Serial Remote.
3. Run remoterm.exe

# Installation (Linux)
For linux there is also a manual available written by me a few years back: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1659552

# Kodi
To get the remote working with Kodi:
1. If running, close remoterm.exe.
2. Replace profiles.ini.
3. Replace keyboard.xml in the Kodi installation directory\system\keymaps.

# Issues
If you got any issues you can contact me through the issues tab on github.
