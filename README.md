# Pinnacle PCTV Serial Remote, Windows Files
There are still a few people looking for the windows files for the Pinnacle PCTV Serial Remote.
So I decided to put them on github. All files needed to get the remote working are included and even the original documentation is added.
I also included a custom configuration to use the remote with Kodi (aka XBMC)
